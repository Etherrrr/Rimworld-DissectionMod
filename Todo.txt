- Custom thougts
- Custom tale?
- Maybe add the chance to catch a disease when dissecting in a none-sterile enviroment?
- Custom inspired (Next dissectio in x days will yield bonus exp)
- To decide: Destroy the body in one bill or make it endure multiple bills for longer dissection (balancing)
  - Multiple builds would require hauling the corpse back to the stockpile
- Custom exp generation
  - Depends on the nutrition values of the body parts right now
    - Probably should use custom calculation as "eyes" are highly interesting for surgery but only yield very low nutrition
  - Bonus for diseases (more knowledge)
  - Malus for destroyed body parts (can't dissect them) -> may already be included in nutrition value?
- Limit the dissection performable on one corpse
  - Only parts like eyes for example
  - Would balance the mod
    - Less exp to gain
	- Still need to get rid of the corpse afterwards
  - May be annoying for the player?
