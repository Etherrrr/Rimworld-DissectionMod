- Custom tale?
- Danger of dissection
  - Actor cuts himself and may even catch an infection?
  - Add a chance to catch diseases the corpse has if the environment is non sterile
- Custom inspired (Next dissection in x days will yield bonus exp)
- Custom exp generation
  - Depends on the nutrition values of the body parts right now
  - Probably should use custom calculation as "eyes" are highly interesting for surgery but only yield very low nutrition
  - Bonus for diseases (more knowledge)
  - Malus for destroyed body parts (can't dissect them) -> may already be included in nutrition value?
- Limit the dissection performable on one corpse
    - Only parts like eyes for example
    - Would balance the mod
    - Less exp to gain
	- Still need to get rid of the corpse afterwards
	- May be annoying for the player?
