- Custom tale?

- Dissection should not use up the body anymore. Instead remove some parts but leave the body for further usage (butchering, biofuel, etc.)

- Use custom JobDriver inherited from JobDriver_DoBill for these bills (much cleaner solution)
	- Go to body
	- Bring it to table
	- Strip it
	- Start dissecting
	- Check regulary if max learning is done or another task came in
		- If so, bring away the corpse
		
- Do not start dissection (unless forced) if learning threshold is over 75%

- Add autopsy room type with related mood buffs/penalties
- Tweak thoughts / mood buffs
- Tweak xp/duration (Dissecting for 3 hours should give 4000xp)
