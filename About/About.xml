	<description>Medical Dissection adds a dissection table to the game, allowing your doctors to train on human corpses. You can add the mod to an existing save.

Feature overview
- Performing dissections allows your doctors to train their medicine skill on humanoid corpses
- Colonists assigned to the new "Study Medicine" work type will perform dissection bills at a dissection table to train their skill
- Dissecting a single body takes 1.5 ingame hours and grants 3000xp (adjustable in settings)
- Dissection removes random body parts and organs from the corpse
- Colonists may accidentally destroy corpses in the dissection process (lower chance with higher medicine skill)
- A corpse can only be dissected once (A "Allow dissected" and "Allow not dissected" filter can help you to set up your storages and butcher bills efficiently)
- Custom thoughts and tales
